## Issues Fixed

1. **Auth Client Errors**: Changed from `const supabase = createClient;` to proper imports
2. **Missing Sound Files**: Created placeholder files in `/public/sounds/`
3. **Supabase 406 Errors**: Added proper Accept headers to both clients
4. **Missing Database Tables**: Created migrations for all advanced features

## Migrations Created

1. `20240726_create_advanced_features.sql` - Implementation intentions, commitment contracts, priming cues, scheduled cues
2. `20240726_create_future_self.sql` - Future self visualizations
3. `20240726_create_reviews_and_lootbox.sql` - Weekly reviews and lootbox history

## Next Steps

1. Apply the migrations to the database:
   ```bash
   npx supabase db push
   ```

2. Test all advanced features after migration

3. Add actual sound files (currently placeholders)

4. Monitor for any remaining console errors

## Overall Status

The core application functionality is working well. The main issues were related to missing database tables for advanced features, which have been addressed with new migrations. Once these migrations are applied, all features should work correctly.
